# The npm runner: the harness itself (see base.Dockerfile) plus nothing else -- npm ships with the
# node:24-bookworm-slim base already used, unlike maven.Dockerfile's Temurin/Maven layers. Its first
# layers intentionally repeat base.Dockerfile's rather than `FROM` a separately built tag, for the
# same reason maven.Dockerfile's header gives: Docker Compose has no way to guarantee a sibling
# service's image is built first, short of an extra explicit prebuild step, and duplicating these
# cheap, well-cached layers here keeps the already-proven "skeleton" service untouched.
FROM node:24-bookworm-slim

# The harness's directory in the build context (RPS-1500): `.` when the context is e2e/ (docker-compose.runners.yml),
# a path such as `repsy-os/e2e` when another repository builds from a parent directory. Every COPY of the
# harness's own files below is relative to it. Declared after FROM, so it is in scope for this stage only.
